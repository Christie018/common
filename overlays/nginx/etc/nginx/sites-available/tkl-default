# This is an improved default nginx site provided by TurnKey Linux. The
# original site provided by Debian nginx packagers can be found at
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.

# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.
